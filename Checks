****./philo 5 800 200 200 7 | grep "is eating" | awk '{print $2}' | sort | uniq -c ***

Test 4 310 200 100. One Philosopher should die.
*** ./philo 4 310 200 100 | tee >(grep "died" > died_log.txt) | grep "is eating" ***  or 
*** /philo 4 310 200 100 | grep "died" ***
Test with 2 philosophers and check the differen times: a death delayed by more than 10ms is unacceptable.
